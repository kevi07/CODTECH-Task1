### Objective

The primary objective of this project was to analyze and understand the key factors influencing car prices and performance, identify patterns, and draw actionable insights from the data.

### Key Activities

- **Data Collection**: Sourced a detailed dataset containing various attributes of cars, including make, model, year, price, mileage, and more.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating informative and interactive visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing and potential predictive modeling.
